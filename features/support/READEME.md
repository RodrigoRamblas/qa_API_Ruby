### Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/) - Wondering why Ruby is so popular? Its fans call it a beautiful, artful language. And yet, they say itâ€™s handy and practical. What gives?
* [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) - Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby. Making TDD Productive and Fun.
* [httParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) - Makes http fun again! Ain't no party like a httparty, because a httparty don't stop.

### Installation

This project requires [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) latest release to run.
